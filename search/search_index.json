The [breakout rooms] and the way of teaching helped greatly.   I do have to say the pace was quite fast tho and I am very happy   to have had some people in the same [breakout rooms]   that knew so much beforehand. Still, I am quite confused how to find   everything that I want to do, especially all the commands and   requirements before using the commands. The documentation is very nicely   structured, and helped a lot, but for a total beginners it felt like a   maze. I am a bit sad, that we could not try writing the script in the   [breakout rooms] due to time [reasons] as I think that is quite important   and I have low confidence in doing so on my own.

I've fixed it under course time. I was I made the unclarity visible.</p> <p>Besides the variability in the learners, I think it went as good as it could. I think I was able to create a welcoming, warm learning atmosphere. I took good care of learners that were later than the rest. I must give credit to the learners themselves too, as they helped me make the course enjoyable.</p> <p>I felt the group was getting less focussed, more viscous to work with after the break.</p> <p>So, let's take a look at the evaluation results.</p>"},{"location":"reflections/20250210/#evaluation","title":"Evaluation","text":"<ul> <li>Number of learners at 14:45: 13</li> <li>Numer of responses: 9</li> <li>Response rate: 69%</li> </ul> <p>This is the feedback at end of confidences, with only spelling corrections added:</p> <ul> <li>Day 1 on this course has been very useful,   I learned a lot through these sessions,   and I really liked doing the exercises in breakout rooms and   discussing each question with others.   I also liked Rich\u00e8l's way of teaching,   he was very positive and supportive.</li> </ul> <p>Nice.</p> <ul> <li>Very nice intro!   Felt like being thrown unprepared into a swimming pool.   But I didn't drown, thanks to other swimmers   that showed me how to stay above the water. ;-)</li> </ul> <p>I wonder how I could help better here: was it just the other swimmers, or was I involved as well? Well, it is the goal to include everybody by having different groups, so I guess that worked for this learner!</p> <ul> <li>Richel is very nice and welcoming since the beginning of the class.   The course is fun, less lectures more practicing.   But it seems that the target for today may be a bit too much unless   more time is added, or maybe extend the course to 4 days.</li> </ul> <p>This is the first of two learners stating there is too much content in the course.</p> <ul> <li>For a complete beginner, the amount of information is huge.   The [breakout rooms] and the way of teaching helped greatly.   I do have to say the pace was quite fast tho and I am very happy   to have had some people in the same [breakout rooms]   that knew so much beforehand. Still, I am quite confused how to find   everything that I want to do, especially all the commands and   requirements before using the commands. The documentation is very nicely   structured, and helped a lot, but for a total beginners it felt like a   maze. I am a bit sad, that we could not try writing the script in the   [breakout rooms] due to time [reasons] as I think that is quite important   and I have low confidence in doing so on my own.   Concluding, I feel that this course is very valuable especially   with in this learning format but more time would have been needed.</li> </ul> <p>This is the second of two learners stating there is too much content in the course. Again, he/she states that the usefulness of the breakout rooms.</p> <p>Anonymous feedback:</p> <ul> <li>Great introduction to uppmax and linux, learned a lot!</li> </ul> <p>Nice.</p> <ul> <li>I enjoyed the teacher's way of interacting and engaging with us students.   Making it feel like a safe environment for asking questions.   Also liked working in smaller breakout rooms bit the downside being some   interactions where more fruitful than others.   Where it feels you can easily get lost   and not follow if not everyone is on board of the students.   But all in all a very useful session!</li> </ul> <p>Nice. And indeed, some groups were not as good as others. And I could be better in nudging these to be be better, I just don't know how.</p> <p>So, 2 out of 11 learners state there was too much course content. And I agree with this: I've added a session on backups and I naively thought it would all still work. It did not.</p> <ul> <li>[x] Remove session on backups</li> </ul> <p>I think this quote is valuable:</p> <p>The documentation is very nicely structured, and helped a lot, but for a total beginners it felt like a maze.</p> <p>I feel the day should start with an overview of running an analysis on UPPMAX.
