The course is fun, less lectures more practicing.   But it seems that the target for today may be a bit too much unless   more time is added, or maybe extend the course to 4 days.</li> <li>For a complete beginner, the amount of information is huge.   The [breakout rooms] and the way of teaching helped greatly.   I do have to say the pace was quite fast tho and I am very happy   to have had some people in the same [breakout rooms]   that knew so much beforehand. Still, I am quite confused how to find   everything that I want to do, especially all the commands and   requirements before using the commands. The documentation is very nicely   structured, and helped a lot, but for a total beginners it felt like a   maze. I am a bit sad, that we could not try writing the script in the   [breakout rooms] due to time [reasons] as I think that is quite important   and I have low confidence in doing so on my own.

This can start with the syllabus and extend   to face-to-face and online interactions with students.</li> <li>[Yes] Encourage respectful and supportive peer interactions,   providing students\u2019   opportunities to collaborate in building understanding,   identify shared interests in   course content, and develop a supportive classroom network.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Pedagogical choices:<ul> <li>[Yes] Signal an identify-safe environment with inclusive language or   by highlighting successes   of individuals from stereotyped groups.   This can lessen stereotype threat and improve   student performance and participation.</li> <li>[N/A] Feature counterstereotypical examples of scientists   in homework assignments to   introduce course content. Doing so can increase students\u2019 sense of   relating to scientists,   shift them away from stereotypes about scientists,   and improve course grades.</li> <li>[Yes] Know and use student names. Name tents are one way to achieve   facilitate this practice in high enrollment courses.</li> <li>[Yes] Use wait time, small groups, think-pair-share,   and writing time as well as other   strategies that enhance students\u2019 opportunities   to contribute and benefit from the   intellectual community of the classroom.</li> <li>[N/A] Increase course structure through graded out-of-class assignments   and in-class active learning, including the strategies listed above.</li> <li>[Yes] Enhance cooperation and reduce competition among students   to help promote student   feelings of success.</li> <li>[Unsure] Emphasize the relevance of coursework to real life in order   to enhance student interest and engagement.</li> <li>[Yes] Support students' sense of autonomy to increase interest   and enjoyment and possibly decrease anxiety measures.</li> <li>[Yes] Read about and consider using social-psychological interventions   that are a suited to your students and your context.   These interventions may focus on helping students   endorse a growth mindset;   helping students understand adversity as shared, transient   experiences to increase social belonging;   or helping combat stereotype threat through   values affirmation.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Of course, the 'Yes' should be read as a 'I think so, but I can be wrong'.

For now, I conclude I am inclusive enough, until there is evidence on the opposite.</p> <p>Another study, <code>[Shady et al., 2013]</code>, does an experiment with training teachers in being more inclusive, with a survey before and after the training.

I am a bit sad, that we could not try writing the script in the   [breakout rooms] due to time [reasons] as I think that is quite important   and I have low confidence in doing so on my own.

Good job me :-)</p> <ul> <li>1:42 \u2013 Room 3 were out and then they were moved back   after they realized they did not do the task.</li> </ul> <p>Yes, they were indeed not yet finished. This was partly my mistake: I only mentioned twice to do two sessions and I did not repeat in the breakout room. Still, I am happy that this can be sorted out easily.</p> <p>[And the questions I asked my colleague to rate me on:]</p> <ul> <li>Consider how you demonstrate warmth, organization,   and respect for students as part   of developing a positive classroom climate.   This can start with the syllabus and extend   to face-to-face and online interactions with students.<ul> <li>Warmth : Encourages students to give answer, even wrong ones.</li> <li>Organization : Breakout room for focused work withing small teams.   Easy to follow exercises.   Expectation setting with course overview.   Quizzes/tests at the beginning and end of exercises.</li> <li>Respect : Everyone is welcome no matter the prior knowledge they have.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>I said 'Yes', we seem to agree.</p> <ul> <li>Encourage respectful and supportive peer interactions,   providing students\u2019   opportunities to collaborate in building understanding,   identify shared interests in   course content, and develop a supportive classroom network.<ul> <li>Breakout rooms as a tool to collaborate. Encouraging videos for   trust building and exercises to   complete tasks together.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>I said 'Yes', we seem to agree.</p> <ul> <li>Signal an identify-safe environment with inclusive language or   by highlighting successes   of individuals from stereotyped groups.   This can lessen stereotype threat and improve   student performance and participation.<ul> <li>Students are free to leave if they have important things to do.</li> <li>All students were equally encouraged, including the stereotyped groups</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>I said 'Yes', we seem to agree.</p> <ul> <li>Feature counterstereotypical examples of scientists   in homework assignments to   introduce course content. Doing so can increase students\u2019 sense of   relating to scientists,   shift them away from stereotypes about scientists,   and improve course grades.<ul> <li>NA</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>I said 'N/A', we seem to agree.</p> <ul> <li>Know and use student names. Name tents are one way to achieve   facilitate this practice in high enrollment courses.<ul> <li>Did well.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>I said 'Yes', we seem to agree.</p> <ul> <li>Use wait time, small groups, think-pair-share,   and writing time as well as other   strategies that enhance students\u2019 opportunities   to contribute and benefit from the   intellectual community of the classroom.<ul> <li>Did all of these.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>I said 'Yes', we seem to agree.</p> <ul> <li>Increase course structure through graded out-of-class assignments   and in-class active learning, including the strategies listed above.<ul> <li>Feedback form was a tool to do this and students were requested   to fill those before leaving.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>I said 'N/A', we seem to disagree. And I understand we may have different ideas here: I have no idea what this item means exactly. I should read the paper better here.</p> <ul> <li> <p>[ ] Read paper to understand this item</p> </li> <li> <p>Enhance cooperation and reduce competition among students   to help promote student feelings of success.</p> <ul> <li>Answered via previous comments regarding enhancing cooperation.   Competition was   inherently decreased via those activities too.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>I said 'Yes', we seem to agree.</p> <ul> <li>Emphasize the relevance of coursework to real life in order   to enhance student interest and engagement.<ul> <li>Talked a little bit the use cases in the beginning of exercises.   It was an adequate amount.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>I said 'Unsure' and it seems to be a yes. Yay!</p> <ul> <li>Support students' sense of autonomy to increase interest   and enjoyment and possibly decrease anxiety measures.<ul> <li>Self-evaluation structure of the course with reading material,   guides and exercises.</li> <li>Students discussed with one another if they got stuck individually.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>I said 'Yes', we seem to agree.</p> <ul> <li>Read about and consider using social-psychological interventions   that are a suited to your students and your context.   These interventions may focus on helping students   endorse a growth mindset;   helping students understand adversity as shared, transient   experiences to increase social belonging;   or helping combat stereotype threat through   values affirmation.<ul> <li>NA</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>I said 'Yes' and I agree that in the observed part, this was not visible, hence we agree.</p> <p>In conclusion, it seems that my perspective and my colleague's match well!</p>"},{"location":"reflections/20250825/","title":"Reflection","text":"<ul> <li>Date: 2025-08-25</li> <li>Lesson plan</li> <li>Evaluation</li> <li>Reflection</li> </ul> <p>Course was cancelled.</p>"},{"location":"reflections/20251015/","title":"Reflection","text":"<ul> <li>Date: 2025-10-15</li> <li>Lesson plan</li> <li>Evaluation</li> <li>Reflection</li> </ul>"},{"location":"reflections/20251015/#before-teaching","title":"Before teaching","text":"<p>I feel half-ill, so let's see where this goes: it is sometimes better if I am a bit lower in energy :-)</p>"},{"location":"reflections/20251015/#during-teaching","title":"During teaching","text":"<p>At 9:00 sharp, there was 1 learner.
