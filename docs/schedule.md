!!! info "The course is learner-centered"

    The course is learner-centered. This means that the pace is determined
    be the learners (i.e. not by the clock).
    
    This also means, that if we are done earlier, we will end earlier.
    Tip: work together!

    The breaks are always on the time specified.
