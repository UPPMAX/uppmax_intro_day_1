## 16:09

I had a great day with my learners, an observer and a colleague.

I prepared a Menti, but decided against this, as learners
arrived/left/had_a_meeting at very different times.
Also they worked at different speeds. I felt the Menti was made
for the wrong moment. At the end, however, all learners were
at the same subject (i.e. at 14:15, 'Doing real work').
That could be a useful moment to try a Menti. Or maybe at the end?
I am still quite ambivalent in doing quizzes: I do prefer just
asking in person ...

I have had the insight to ask to consider to turn on camera in general room,
i.e. not in the breakout room, as then the discussion on this is not public:
it is just between me and the learner. I first did this the wrong way
around with one learner at around 10:35. At 11:30 I did it the right
way around. It's a nice little insight!


## TODO

- [ ] Check: `0 - I don't even know what this is about`
  is missing in the Google Forms
- [ ] `module load python` did not work. Is this
  a temporary thing? Or has this been changed
  to be `module load Python`?
- [ ] The file manager picture (in the answer) is
  of Thunar (which was the file manager on a previous
  system). This threw the learners off longer than
  expected. Update that image.
