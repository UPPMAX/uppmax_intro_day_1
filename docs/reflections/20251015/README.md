## Before teaching

I feel half-ill, so let's see where this goes:
it is sometimes better if I am a bit lower in energy :-)

## During teaching

At 9:00 sharp, there was 1 learner. I started anyways.
At 9:05, there were 4, which would be the group for
the rest of the morning/day.

I did not ask the learners to turn on their camera immediately,
as an experiment. This felt bad: I felt unconnected to my learners.

- [ ] Ask learners to turn on their cameras before the first exercise

When I asked for the cameras for the first Prior, 3 out of 4 were turned
on. Some Priors later, 4 out of 4 cameras will be on.

- [ ] Ask Diana to mention clearer that a good Zoom setup is strongly
  recommended

Both groups reported that the UPPMAX documentation was
incorrect. I updated it
[with this commit](https://github.com/UPPMAX/UPPMAX-documentation/commit/3014957a2116acb219ab1b03ed84e4a01e1dd58b).
I am happy to notice that learners were comfortable enough to point out
mistakes and that I immediately fixed them.
