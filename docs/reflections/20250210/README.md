# Reflection 2025-02-10

This group had more variation in how fast the learners went through the
exercise. I felt it was useless to rush them through the earlier exercises.
Instead, from 15:30-15:45 I **lectured**. I told them that the learning
objective ('so you have **seen** it').
I feel this most likely reason for this, is the new session
about backups: it took away 30 minutes.

I informed my colleagues about the state of the learning of the students,
so that they can adapt.

Maybe for next time:

- Remove: modules
- Remove: create a script
- Remove: submit a script
- Add back in: I can conclude which UPPMAX cluster best suits my needs
- Add back in: I can find the hardware specifications of an UPPMAX cluster
- Add back in: I can find where to apply for NAISS resources
- Add back in: I can find other UPPMAX courses

It would feel weird not to run a batch job though,
so I feel alternatively:

- Remove: backups

This is my favorite. I will move backups to the optional material.

There was an unclarity in the
course material about backups that was found (and shared) by two independent
groups. I've fixed it under course time. I was I made the unclarity
visible.

Besides the variability in the learners, I think it went as good as it could.
I think I was able to create a welcoming, warm learning atmosphere.
I took good care of learners that were later than the rest.
I must give credit to the learners themselves too, as they
helped me make the course enjoyable.

So, let's take a look at the evaluation results.
