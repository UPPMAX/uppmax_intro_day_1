# Reflection 2025-02-10

This group had more variation in how fast the learners went through the
exercise. I felt it was useless to rush them through the earlier exercises.
Instead, from 15:30-15:45 I **lectured**. I told them that the learning
objective ('so you have **seen** it'). I don't know what is
the cause of the learners being slow. I would be able to assume that
they just are (which is fine), but I worry it is my teaching. If
it was me, no idea why: let's hope the evaluation can help me find
the reason.
I informed my colleagues about the state of the learning of the students,
so that they can adapt.

Besides the variability in the learners, I think it went as good as it could.
I think I was able to create a welcoming, warm learning atmosphere.
I took good care of learners that were later than the rest.
I must give credit to the learners themselves too, as they
helped me make the course enjoyable.

Hmm, maybe the group sizes should be 2 instead of 3...?

So, let's take a look at the evaluation results.
