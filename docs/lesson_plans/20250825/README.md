Changes:

- Use Pelle instead of Rackham
- The event will take place IRL

Procedure to migrate to Pelle:

- Update all course material pages.
  If there is an UPPMAX doc page change needed, do so

Procedure to prepare for IRL teaching:

- Re-read that part of the literature again
  and write down my rules

Change of plan:

I have only one week to find out all the quirks in Pelle.
My teaching depends on this.
I have no idea why the choice was made to use Pelle, instead
of Rackham.
If the intro course fails due to Pelle not being ready,
it was not my choice to use Pelle.

First, check if all technology works and report things that are missing:

Page                        |Status
----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prerequisites               |Works
Course dates                |Works
Schedule                    |Works
Login                       |Works
Login to remote desktop     |Website `https://pelle-gui.uppmax.uu.se` fails, ThinLinc works
Use the remote desktop      |Works
File transfer with FileZilla|Works
Login console               |`xeyes` absent, use `eog` instead anyways
Use terminal                |Works
Module system               |Works
Creating a bash script      |Works
Scheduler                   |Works
Interactive jobs            |Works

Great, this seems to work! I've reported the two defects
and I can live without them.

Next steps:

- Prepare IRL teaching
- Fix UPPMAX docs
- Add UPPMAX docs videos
- Fix this courses' docs
- Add videos to this courses' docs

### IRL teaching

My considerations:

- Add quizzes
- Split tables in groups based on operating system

Let's start reading the literature.

I will start from `[Bell, 2020]`...
Nope, this has no classroom management in it ...

Let's try `[Schwartz & Gurung, 2012]`..
Chapter 2: Building rapport in the classroom:
- Consider adding I will touch on the shoulder to help the learner
  draw his/her attention to me.
