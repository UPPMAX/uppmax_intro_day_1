Changes:

- Use Pelle instead of Rackham
- The event will take place IRL

Procedure to migrate to Pelle:

- Update all course material pages.
  If there is an UPPMAX doc page change needed, do so

Procedure to prepare for IRL teaching:

- Re-read that part of the literature again
  and write down my rules

Change of plan:

I have only one week to find out all the quirks in Pelle.
My teaching depends on this.
I have no idea why the choice was made to use Pelle, instead
of Rackham.
If the intro course fails due to Pelle not being ready,
it was not my choice to use Pelle.

First, check if all technology works
