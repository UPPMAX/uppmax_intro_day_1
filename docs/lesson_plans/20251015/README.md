## 2025-08-21

The course of 2025-08-25 was cancelled.
A new course has been scheduled at 2025-10-15
As I now have scheduled time to prepare (and I will not have
this time in the middle of October), let's prepare now!

Already due to my earlier preparation,
this is the status of the technology

I can imagine that the remote desktop website will be up soon too.

Let's check the status of the course materials:

Let's test the module system lesson now ...
It works just fine, let's make a video now ...
Done ...

Things I want to try out new:

- Add quizzes

About quizzes, from `[Glodowski et al., 2020]`:

- Quizzes should be frequent
- Quizzes should be administered in-class
- [Does not apply] Quizzes should have a connection to the exam
- Feedback for answer accuracy
- An effective grade-related or social contingency. Or, in my words:
  the quizzes must be related to grades in an effective way,
  or use social pressure to convince the learners to do so.

I wonder, don't I already do so? I know I sometimes ask the Prior
questions again at the end. Or I prepare Feedback questions.
That counts!

Hence, I am done, after preparing the Feedback questions. Let's do it!

## 2025-10-13

In two days, the course is taught. And tomorrow I will be teaching
the NAISS Intro to Python course, so I must prepare today.
