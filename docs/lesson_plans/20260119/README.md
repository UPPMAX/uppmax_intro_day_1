This will be the fourth course iteration, so I expect little work.

Let's take a look at the
[the reflection of last time](../../reflections/20251015/README.md).

- [ ] Ask learners to turn on their cameras before the first exercise
- [Asked] Ask Diana to mention clearer that a good Zoom setup is strongly
  recommended

## 2026-01-12

I will have an observer!

This will mean that I need to check
[my notes when I was observed previously](https://uppmax.github.io/naiss_intro_python/reflections/20251127/):

- Do introduce the observer
  - Learners are not allowed to ask questions about the course content:
    he is not a teaching assistant
  - He is free to do whatever he/she wants, including asking questions
- Tell the observer beforehand:
  - He is free to do whatever he/she wants,
    including asking questions, turning on/off camera,
    introducing himself yes/no

Adding quizzes? That is an idea I wanted to try... hmmm ... 
Let's see later if I am interested...

## Observer questions

- I teach following Mike Bell's five-step model: Prior, Present, Challenge, 
  Feedback, Repreat. Where do you think I am weakest?
- What are things that were surprising to you?
