## 2026-01-07

This will be the fourth course iteration, so I expect little work.

Let's take a look at the
[the reflection of last time](../../reflections/20251015/README.md).

- [ ] Ask learners to turn on their cameras before the first exercise
- [Asked] Ask Diana to mention clearer that a good Zoom setup is strongly
  recommended

## 2026-01-12

I will have an observer!

This will mean that I need to check
[my notes when I was observed previously](https://uppmax.github.io/naiss_intro_python/reflections/20251127/):

- Do introduce the observer
    - Learners are not allowed to ask questions about the course content:
    he is not a teaching assistant
    - He is free to do whatever he/she wants, including asking questions
- Tell the observer beforehand:
    - He is free to do whatever he/she wants,
    including asking questions, turning on/off camera,
    introducing himself yes/no

Adding quizzes? That is an idea I wanted to try... hmmm ...
Let's see later if I am interested...

## Observer questions

- I teach following Mike Bell's five-step model: Prior, Present, Challenge,
  Feedback, Repeat. Where do you think I am weakest?
- What are things that were surprising to you?

## 2026-01-16

I will meet the observer on the day of teaching, at 12:30.
I did not want to complicate things by suggesting to arrive at the
end, as there is no fixed schedule. I think the beginning and
end are the most interesting (as a teacher is talking most there),
but I predict I will learn something from the observer observing
midway: I ask him to be super critical!

Let's think about quizzes if I have the time for this today.
This Monday I will not be able to login to Pelle myself, due to
technical issues (my mobile phone is in repairs). Let's first
check if I get away with this.

- Check if can teach without 2FA
- Check internal communication channels
- Find out quizzing software

No, the quizzing software will be hardest. I do this first.

Should I do quizzes? It is mostly skills I teach. Maybe quizzes are unsuitable
for that? Maybe I should just try...

OK, I tried Mentimeter. What I don't want is a scoreboard. What I do not
want is that learners have to type their name. I conclude that a Menti
Quiz is unsuitable.

Maybe a Menti Survey is suitable ...

```text
Which of these are Pelle environments?

Console, Desktop, SSH, Terminal, ThinLinc, Website

How is the computer called that you are working on after login?

- Login node
- A login node
- The login node

Which of these can maybe be run on the login node? What are the cases where it depends?

- Copy a dataset to another folder
- Create a directory
- Download a dataset
- Edit a file using an IDE such as RStudio, VSCode or VSCodium
- Edit a file using a simple text editor such as `emacs`, `nano` or `vim`
- Run a Bash/Nextflow/Python/R script
```

Yes, a Menti Survey is suitable.

Time to read the literature on *how* to best use quizzes. I will search
Google Scholar with 'best practices of using quizzes in teaching' and take
the first useful hits.

- `[Tofade et al, 2013]`, usefulness 7/10:
    - 'The phrasing and clarity of words used in formulating a question
      greatly influences its effectiveness'
    - 'It is best to ask a variety of questions that address different
      cognitive levels and knowledge domains'
    - 'A psychologically unsafe environment will prevent students from
      expressing their thoughts and opinions aloud'
    - 'Two additional components of effective questioning are sequencing and
      balance. Sequencing is asking questions in a patterned order with the
      purpose to elicit meaningful responses from the audience.
      Balance is asking both convergent and divergent questions
      from multiple knowledge domains and at varying cognitive levels'
    - 'Wait time influences the quality and quantity of student
      responses as well'
    - 'a wait time of more than 20 seconds may be perceived as threatening
      and result in equally poor responses'
    - 'Pimping questions are typically asked in rapid succession,
      are unlikely to be answered correctly,
      and leave most learners feeling demoralized'
- `[Nguyen and McDaniel, 2015]`: usefulness 5/10.
- `[Cook and Babon, 2017]`: usefulness 2/10, follow learners' perspective

Hmmm, I see that Menti is quite capable of being interrupted and resumed.
I like that!

I am unsure about the usefulness of the surveys to help improve
my course (i.e. the self-rated confidence). However, they do help
the learners. I keep these in for now.

Update:

- Use `xclock` instead of `eog`
- Replace Thunar by Pluma

## 2026-01-19

Goal of today: stay chill, take the time needed, do not go too fast.

Find a better order at the start:

- Me talking
- Exercise what we are going to learn
- Learners talking

I've added two quizess, I will try these out and see how it feel.
