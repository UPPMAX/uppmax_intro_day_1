## 2025-01-23

As far as I know, there are no changes requested for this course.
Let's take a look at [../../reflections/20240827/README.md).

- Expected number of learners: 17
- Use group size of 3   
- The FileZilla session was weakest,
  with an average confidence of 4 out of 5

Taking a look at the FileZilla session,
what can be improved in the lesson material:

- [ ] Add a video to do so, to the UPPMAX docs

I do miss a FAQ in this course

- [ ] Add FAQ, copy from 'Intro to Python's
