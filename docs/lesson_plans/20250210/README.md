# Lesson plan 2025-02-10

As far as I know, there are no changes requested for this course.
Let's take a look at [../../reflections/20240827/README.md).

- Expected number of learners: 17
- Use group size of 3
- The FileZilla session was weakest,
  with an average confidence of 4 out of 5

Taking a look at the FileZilla session,
what can be improved in the lesson material:

- [ ] [Add a video to do so, to the UPPMAX docs](https://github.com/UPPMAX/uppmax_intro_day_1/issues/6)

I do miss a FAQ in this course

- [x] Add FAQ, copy from 'Intro to Python's

The answers of [using the remote desktop](../../sessions/use_remote_desktop.md),
exercise 2 should be added. Dull, but it annoys me that this is incomplete.

Also:

- [ ] [Consider adding `backup` and `nobackup`](https://github.com/UPPMAX/uppmax_intro_day_1/issues/8)

Read up on 'Inclusive teaching', found `[Dewsbury & Brame, 2018]` and
[this PDF](inclusive_teaching_checklist.pdf):

- Classroom climate:
  - [Yes] Consider how you demonstrate warmth, organization, and respect for students as part
    of developing a positive classroom climate. This can start with the syllabus and extend
    to face-to-face and online interactions with students.
  - [Yes] Encourage respectful and supportive peer interactions, providing students’
    opportunities to collaborate in building understanding, identify shared interests in
    course content, and develop a supportive classroom network. 
- Pedagogical choices:
  - [Yes] Signal an identify-safe environment with inclusive language or by highlighting successes
    of individuals from stereotyped groups. This can lessen stereotype threat and improve
    student performance and participation.
  - [N/A] Feature counterstereotypical examples of scientists in homework assignments to
    introduce course content. Doing so can increase students’ sense of relating to scientists,
    shift them away from stereotypes about scientists, and improve course grades.
  - [Yes] Know and use student names. Name tents are one way to achieve facilitate this practice
    in high enrollment courses.
  - [Yes] Use wait time, small groups, think-pair-share, and writing time as well as other
    strategies that enhance students’ opportunities to contribute and benefit from the
    intellectual community of the classroom.
  - [N/A] Increase course structure through graded out-of-class assignments and in-class active
    learning, including the strategies listed above.
  - [Yes] Enhance cooperation and reduce competition among students to help promote student
    feelings of success.
  - [Unsure] Emphasize the relevance of coursework to real life in order to enhance student interest
    and engagement.
  - [Yes] Support students’ sense of autonomy to increase interest and enjoyment and possibly
    decrease anxiety measures.
  - [Yes] Read about and consider using social-psychological interventions that are a suited to
    your students and your context. These interventions may focus on helping students
    endorse a growth mindset; helping students understand adversity as shared, transient
    experiences to increase social belonging; or helping combat stereotype threat through
    values affirmation. 

Other papers causing me to believe I do reasonably well: 

  - `[Amayo et al., 2021]`: 12 simple tips
  - `[Dewsbury, 2017]` (useless for me, it is at a higher level)

It annoys me that these papers are mostly about the inclusion
of people with different skin colors, instead of how to include
people with social anxiety. For now, I conclude I am inclusive enough,
until there is evidence on the opposite.

Another study, `[Shady et al., 2013]`, does an experiment with
training teachers in being more inclusive, with a survey before and after
the training. The survey question 'I feel that inclusion will lead to positive
changes in the educational system' was agreed upon 44% before and 12%
after the training (and a year of implementing it).
