Feedback at end of confidences:

- 5x NA
- Day 1 on this course has been very useful, I learned a lot through these sessions, and I really liked doing the exercises in breakout rooms and discussing each question with others. I also liked Rich√®l's way of teaching, he was very positive and supportive.
- Very nice intro! Felt like being thrown unprepared into a swimming pool. But I didn't drown, thanks to other swimmers that showed me how to stay above the water. ;-)
- Richel is very nice and welcoming since the beginning of the class. The course is fun, less lectures more practicing. But it seems that the target for today may be a bit too much unless more time is added, or maybe extend the course to 4 days.
- For a complete beginner, the amount of information is huge. The breakoutrooms and the way of teaching helped greatly. I do have to say the pace was quite fast tho and I am very happy to have had some people in the same breakoutrooms that knew so much beforehand. Still, I am quite confused how to find everything that I want to do, especially all the commands and requirements before using the commands. The documentation is very nicely structured, and helped a lot, but for a total beginners it felt like a maze. I am a bit sad, that we could not try writing the script in the breakoutrooms due to time resounse as I think that is quite important and I have low confidence in doing so on my own. Concluding, I feel that this course is very valuable especially with in this learning format but more time would have been needed.

Anonymous feedback:

- Great introduction to uppmax and linux, learned a lot!"
- I enjoyed the teacher's way of interacting and engaging with us students. Making it feel like a safe environment for asking questions. Also liked working in smaller breakout rooms bit the downside being some interactions where more fruitful than others. Where it feels you can easily get lost and not follow if not everyone is on board of the students. But all in all a very useful session!"
