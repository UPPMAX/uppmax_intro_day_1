I also liked Rich√®l's way of teaching, he was very positive and supportive."

The course is fun, less lectures more practicing. But it seems that the target for today may be a bit too much unless more time is added, or maybe extend the course to 4 days. "

The breakoutrooms and the way of teaching helped greatly. I do have to say the pace was quite fast tho and I am very happy to have had some people in the same breakoutrooms that knew so much beforehand. Still, I am quite confused how to find everything that I want to do, especially all the commands and requirements before using the commands. The documentation is very nicely structured, and helped a lot, but for a total beginners it felt like a maze. I am a bit sad, that we could not try writing the script in the breakoutrooms due to time resounse as I think that is quite important and I have low confidence in doing so on my own. Concluding, I feel that this course is very valuable especially with in this learning format but more time would have been needed. "
