## Why?

Login nodes are used interactively for light processes, e.g. submitting a job.
However, sometimes one needs to do harder things interactively, e.g.
running an IDE.

In this session, we learn how to start an interactive session.


## Interactive jobs

- Most work is most effective as submitted jobs, but e.g. development needs responsiveness
- Interactive jobs are high-priority but limited in `-n` and `-t`
- Quickly give you a job and logs you in to the compute node
- Require same Slurm parameters as other jobs

``````{challenge} Try interactive

```  {code-block} console
$ interactive -A naiss2023-22-793 -p core -n 1 -t 10:00
```
- Which node are you on?
  - Logout with `<Ctrl>-D` or `logout`
``````
