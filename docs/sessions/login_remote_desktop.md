## Why?

You want to use an HPC cluster with a visual and familiar user interface.

## A remote desktop environment

Most people use a desktop environment:

Operating system|Example desktop environment
----------------|--------------------------
Linux           |![https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ubuntu_24.04_Noble_Numbat_Desktop_English.png](ubuntu.png)
MacOS/OS X      |![https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Mac_OS#/media/File:MacOS81_screenshot.png](apple.png)
MS-DOS          |![https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Windows_3.0_workspace.png](windows.png)

The UPPMAX clusters provide for a remote desktop environment.
It is a remote environment, as we need to log in to a cluster remotely,
i.e. we do not plug in our keyboard and monitor to a node.

There are two ways to access the remote remote desktop environment of Rackham:

- use a website
- use a program

In this session, we will access the Rackham remote desktop environment.
