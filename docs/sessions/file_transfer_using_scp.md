???- question "For teachers"

    Teaching goals are:

      %% It took me 6 mins, here I do that time x2
      Challenge: crit, challenge, after present, 12s
      %% Here I use the same time it took me to give feedback

    ```

    Prior questions:

    - How can one do a file transfer from the terminal?
    - Can you name some programs that can do file transfer from the terminal?
    - Who has heard of `scp`?
    - Who has already used `scp`?

## Why?

Fairly sure you'll want to upload or download files to Pelle.
Here we do so.

We use a free and open-source graphical tool to do this,
called SCP.
It works under Linux, Mac and Windows.
