## Why?

...

## Install software yourself

- You can install in your home directory.
    - This is handy for personal needs, low numbers of files (i.e. not Conda).
- Usually better to install in project directory.
    - This way the project contains both data and software â€” good for reproducibility, collaboration, and everyone's general sanity.

- [Python](http://docs.uppmax.uu.se/software/python/)
  with `pip install`
- [Conda](http://docs.uppmax.uu.se/software/conda/)
  with `conda install`
- Docker: does not work
- [Singularity](http://docs.uppmax.uu.se/software/singularity/)
  and upload a container
- Build from source
    - We have several compiler versions from GNU and Intel
    - [Compiling from source code](https://www.uppmax.uu.se/support/user-guides/compiling-source-code/)
    - [Guide for compiling serial and parallel programs](https://www.uppmax.uu.se/support/user-guides/mpi-and-openmp-user-guide/)
- Spack
    - The UPPMAX staff has already other ways to install most software applications.
    - Please use Spack only if other ways to install your tool is not possible or very difficult, e.g. requiring very many dependencies and it is not available through, e.g. Easybuild.

## Exercises

[...]

### Exercise 1: find the software

Go to the UPPMAX documentation at [https://docs.uppmax.uu.se](https://docs.uppmax.uu.se),
then answer these questions:

- Estimate how many pieces of software are installed on Rackham?

???- question "Answer"

    One can find the answer at <https://docs.uppmax.uu.se/software/software-table/>,
    where one can find around 800 pieces of software installed

### Exercise 2: find the databases

- [UPPMAX databases](http://docs.uppmax.uu.se/databases/overview/)
- Give an estimate of the amount of pre-installed databases

### Exercise 3: work with modules

- [Module system](http://docs.uppmax.uu.se/cluster_guides/modules/)

- Load/use/unload the cowsay module

### (optional) Exercise 4: install software yourself

- Read text above
