Evaluation of observation of Richel 2026-01-19

Starting time (12.30) 13.00

General impressions and thoughts

Introduction was good, well paced and nicely voiced. Moderate tempo, not too overwhelmming. Improvised questions held a good pace and were well formulated. I liked the visual body movements, add a bit of animation to an otherwise static teaching environment (Zoom, online).  

Feedback link presented goes to gmail-adress, might look strange or slightly unprofessional?

For participants who want to skip between online exercises and/or subsections, there seem to be no clear ”back to” or ”top” button option.

Might be good to comment on what commands in CLI is used often, and most necessary to remember, or add text snippets in the instructions to point it out?

Session 1

Room 4 
Partcipants seemed hesitatnt on how/where to start. Social interaction takes over.

Room 2
Discovered that the answer to question on file manager (Caja) is not in agreement with the online resource. Confusion.

Room 1
Communicating really well, off to a good start. Had issues with login errors, could not move forward witout lots of hesitation.

Room 3
Spends a lot of time on navigating basic commands.

Session 2

Good check-up questions! Well paced. Good wth open questions, can be more difficult but also more rewarding. Maybe add a touch of DM issues in the talk, like work habit and good practice when working on an HPC (file cluttering, job cluttering etc.)

File permission exercise – Good to check current permissions before changing! Not give full permissions to everyone all the time!
