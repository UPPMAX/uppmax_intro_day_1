# Reflection 2024-08-27

They day went as good as expected.
I decided to use a group size of 3 people and that was
a god decision. I used the standard exercise setup I've
been using
[as on my website on teaching 'Duo's in Breakout rooms'](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/teaching/blob/master/exercise_procedures/duos_in_breakout_rooms.md).

From the survey feedback (5 responses):

- Even though I knew most of the material already as I have been using UPPMAX, Day 1 was fun and interactive and I could ask questions and get answers to how/why things work, which was nice! Richèl's teaching way is interesting, refreshing I would say. He is very friendly and positive with the students and addressing the questions/issues. He also makes you think rather than just provide the answer so that there is a discussion and this can help with remembering what you learn. Overall happy with Day 1.
- It was a really good introduction for beginner level participants. Great teaching!
- I really liked that the course started with very basic commands and getting to know how to move around in the remote desktop and the terminal. I think that the time to do the exercises was sufficient and if needed we always got help to overcome any errors occuring. The smaller groups made it also easier to help each other and to all manage to be at the same page. 
- Thanks a lot for today.
- It was a good course to start using uppmax. The explanations were clear.

From the anonymous feedback (2 responses):

- The course material was very easy to understand and follow. The course had a nice pace for beginners and Richèl Bilderbeek did a great job!
- Great first day Richèl. Mindful of everyone's time needed for each task.
